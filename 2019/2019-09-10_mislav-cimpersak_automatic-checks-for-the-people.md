# Automatic Checks for the People

## Mislav CimperÅ¡ak

## Summary

Enforcing coding rules one pre-commit hook and one CI job at a time.

Description:
A wise man once said that code is read more often than it is written. And everybody agreed. And everybody continued to write their code in their own "readable" way.

This talk presents ways of putting a stop to endless bikeshedding discussions during the development life cycle of a Python project.

Uniformed code base and high code quality can be maintained with various tools that take care of formatting, code smells, security issues, etc. Let's face it, using such tools is a lot cheaper than using your devs for these mundane tasks.

A lot of methods presented in the talk are not strictly "Python specific" and can be used when working with other languages as well.
